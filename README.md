Random password generator
Used starter code provided by bootcamp to create a random password generator. 
The user clicks a button to generate a password and then must select the lenght of the password between 8-128 characters.
The user is then presented with a number of prompts asking if they want lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters in their password.
Once all pormpts have been answered, a random password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
